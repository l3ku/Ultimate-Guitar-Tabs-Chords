A WordPress plugin that fetches tabs and chords from Ultimate Guitar.

## Installation

This plugin is yet not available via wordpress.org. Installation begins by navigating to the WordPress plugins directory and cloning the plugin git repository by running `git clone git@github.com:l3ku/ultimate-guitar-tabs-chords.git`.

If Composer is used in your project, the plugin can also be included by running `composer require l3ku/ultimate-guitar-tabs-chords`.

The plugin should now be available for activation in the WordPress admin plugins page. After activation, a new admin menu link with the text "UGTC" should be available, which provides access to all plugin settings pages.

That's it, you're ready to go!

## Usage
Specify your content search settings from `UGTC->Search Settings` (e.g. whether to show tabs and/or chords and how to order them)

Add the plugin shortcode to the desired page or post. You can generate the plugin shortcode by using the shortcode generator available on the main plugin page.

## Development
This project is very new and the features of this plugin are still quite limited. Feedback, issues and PR:s are welcome!
